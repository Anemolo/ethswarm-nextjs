Swarm is a system of peer-to-peer networked nodes that create a decentralised storage and communication service. The system is economically self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system enforced through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

Swarm aspires to shape the future towards a self-sovereign global society and permissionless open markets. On Swarm, applications can run autonomously yet securely in a planetary-scale deployment and execution environment.

The Swarm Javascript team is working on a great variety of projects including [**client libraries**](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-js), [**Swarm CLI tool**](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm-cli), the [**Bee Dashboard**](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-dashboard), the [**Swarm Gateway**](https://gateway.ethswarm.org/) and other user facing applications.
