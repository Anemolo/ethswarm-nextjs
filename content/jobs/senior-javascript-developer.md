Swarm is a system of peer-to-peer networked nodes that create a decentralised storage and communication service. The system is economically self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system enforced through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

Swarm aspires to shape the future towards a self-sovereign global society and permissionless open markets. On Swarm, applications can run autonomously yet securely in a planetary-scale deployment and execution environment.

For the development of our client-facing APIs (HTTP and CLI), we’re looking for a strong candidate with experience designing and shaping APIs. Ideally, you should be fluent with API design principles, have experience with full-stack web development and are aware of the friction points of integrating application frameworks in browsers. You’ll get extra points if you understand Web3 concepts and how they affect browser security models.

## Your profile
